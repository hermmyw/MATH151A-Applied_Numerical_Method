C2.	(a) Bisect takes 18 iterations. Reguli-Falsi method takes 4 iterations. 
	(b) The residual for the Bisect method is 7.6293945295e-07. The residual for
	 the Reguli-Falsi method is 2.3757196210e-10.


C3.	Initial bound [1.0, 1.2]
	(a) Bisect takes 17 iterations. Reguli-Falsi method takes 7 iterations. 
	(b) The residual for the Bisect method is 4.8873530132e-06. The residual for
	 the Reguli-Falsi method is 3.3439299041e-07.
	(c) The Reguli-Falsi method is better than Bisection in this case.

	Initial bound [1.0, 2.0]
	(a) Bisect takes 19 iterations. Reguli-Falsi method takes 91 iterations. 
	(b) The residual for the Bisect method is 4.9236944029e-06. The residual for
	 the Reguli-Falsi method is 8.7764181766e-07
	(c) The Reguli-Falsi method is not always better than Bisection. The 
	Reguli-Falsi is optimal when the initial interval is relatively small. As 
	the interval gets wider, the more iterations it needs to take. The number 
	of iterations for bisection method is relatively stable as the range of the 
	initial interval gets wider.
