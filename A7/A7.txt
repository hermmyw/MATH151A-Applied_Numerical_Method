Assignment 7
============
The order of convergence is 2 (quadratic). 
This is because in the list p that calculates log(error_i/error_i+1), 
we get a list of 2's.

When h is very small, we run into the issue of subtraction. In the forward 
difference calculation, x_0 and h are very close values. We have the risk 
of catastrophic cancellation. The result may be inaccurate.
